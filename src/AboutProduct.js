          Remix is a seamless server and browser runtime that provides snappy
          page loads and instant transitions by leveraging distributed systems
          and native browser features instead of clunky static builds. Built on
          the Web Fetch API (instead of Node)
          <span className="font-bold"> it can run anywhere</span>. It already
          runs natively on Cloudflare Workers, and of course supports serverless
          and traditional Node.js environments, so you can come as you are.
